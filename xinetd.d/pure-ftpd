# contents: Xinetd(8) service for ftp using Pure-FTPd.
#
# Copyright © 2006 Nikolai Weibull <now@bitwi.se>
# 
# The setup is as follows:
#
# • A maximum of two connections per user
# • Don’t allow anonymous connections
# • Create user’s home-directories, if they don’t exist already
# • Prevent uploads if hard-drive is more than 90 percent full
# • Allow users to resume and upload files, but not remove files
# • Use /etc/pureftpd/accounts.pdb as passwd file
# • Enable support for the FXP protocol
# • Only allow connections over SSL/TLS
